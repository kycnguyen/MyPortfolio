            <p>Inspiration</p>
            <p>We know Mental Health is important because mental health is human experience. ASRM helped us to release stress when we have depression, so we thought it would be great to share the method we use to deal with stress with others while enhancing programming skills. We hope this small project can contribute to bettering the community's mental health.</p>
            <p>What it does</p>
            <p>website helps people create and customize their own favorites based on provided data of ASMR that we collected on the internet. Users can choose the sounds they like and we will add all of these to a list of ASMR so that users can listen to all their choices afterward. We believe that soundtrack will help people better their mental health.</p>

                <h3>Basic Calculator Java Program</h3>
                <p> This is a simple calculator program that allows you to perform various mathematical
                operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers, 
                as well as calculate expressions containing parentheses. The program is written in Java and I 
                built this program in my Data Structures & Algorithms class. The calculator includes error handling 
                to prevent invalid inputs and ensures accurate calculations.</p>

                <p> The program first takes the arithmetic expression in infix notation and converts it 
                into postfix notation using the shunting yard algorithm. The resulting postfix expression is 
                then evaluated using a stack to keep track of the operands and the operators. The program can 
                handle expressions containing the standard arithmetic operators, parentheses, and negative 
                numbers.</p>

              <h3>Budget Tracking C++ Program</h3>
              <p> After taking the Financial Accounting class, I was encouraged to build this 
              C++ program to better keep track of my monthly budget. The program will be updated by
              adding more functionalities such as recording every transactions, catogorize income and 
              expense, or architected a more user-friendly interface. </p>

              <p>The budget tracking program is a simple tool for tracking your personal 
              finances. It allows you to easily input your income and expenses, and provides you with a clear
              overview of your budget. The program is written in C++, and includes features such as error 
              handling to prevent invalid inputs and ensure accurate calculations. Overall, it's a useful 
              tool for anyone looking to manage their finances more effectively.</p>
